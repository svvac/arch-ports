                          ArchLinux software ports



. ABOUT

This is a collection of PKGBUILD files to build various software on ArchLinux.
Most are contributed to the AUR [1], but they are maintained here for
convenience.

    [1]: https://aur.archlinux.org/



. OPERATION

There's a makefile designed to ease the maintenance process.

    $ make checksum
    $ make srcinfo
    $ make aur-push
    $ make repository
    $ make clean

. PLUMBING

The various packages are maintained as a collection of Git subtrees [2] grouped
in folders by category.


Creation (the remote part is optional):

    $ git remote add aur-my-package ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/my-package.git
    $ git subtree add --prefix=group/my-package aur-my-package master


Push changes: Do your work and commit as usual. Then:

    $ git subtree push --prefix=group/my-package aur-my-package <branch>


Pull changes from upstream:

    $ git subtree pull --prefix=group/my-package aur-my-package master

You could throw in the `--squash` option too to only get a single commit.
